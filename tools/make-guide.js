out(`SQUAD DRAFT — COMPLETE GUIDE FOR STRATEGY ADVICE
A Demon Slayer squad-battler (personal fan game). Generated ${new Date().toISOString().slice(0,10)} from the game's own data.

HOW TO USE THIS FILE (for the assistant reading it)
You are helping a player (Mia) get better at Squad Draft. Everything below is exact game data and rules.
Use it to recommend drafts, counter-picks, move choices and when to use helpers. Health is shown in the game as
a percent of each fighter's own max HP; the raw numbers here (HP, PWR, DEF…) are what the engine uses.
The simulated win rates near the end come from computer-vs-computer games: treat them as hints, not truth.`);

hr('1. THE GAME IN ONE MINUTE');
out(`- Two sides draft a squad of fighters on a points budget, then battle in rounds.
- Each round, every fighter secretly picks ATTACK, DEFEND or their SPECIAL. Then everything resolves.
- Last side with anyone standing wins. A match stopped at round 40 is a draw.
- Modes: Local Multiplayer (one phone passed around, 2–4 players), Online (live: 2–4 phones, 4-letter room code; or
  at your own pace: 2 phones, 6-letter code, each player takes their turn whenever they like),
  Quickplay (you vs 1–3 computers: Easy/Normal/Hard), Practice (you draft every team, the computers' too, then fight
  them; doesn't count toward records) and Story Mode (21 battles with preset squads).
- Each mode (not Story) also sets MAX FIGHTERS PER TEAM, 1–6 (default 6). 1 = one-on-one duels.
- 2v2 TEAMS (4 players): players 1 & 3 vs 2 & 4 (Quickplay: you + an allied computer vs two). Each player drafts
  and controls their own squad; heals, hides, shields and training can target the partner's fighters; Giyu's Dead
  Calm covers both squads; a side wins when the other side has nobody left. The 12-pt card cap applies.
- OPTIONAL BANS (off by default, under "More options"): before the draft each player bans one character.
- SUNRISE: from round 12 (not in Story) demons burn 10% of their max HP every round and stop regenerating
  (Demon King Tanjiro is sun-proof). Long games end; Final Muzan got weaker in long fights.
- STORY UNLOCKS: winning a story battle unlocks the demons, Marks, Legends and alternate versions it introduces for
  every other mode. Base slayers, allies, Hand/Swamp Demon and helpers are always available.
- DAILY CHALLENGE: one preset battle per day with a goal (win / win within N rounds / keep X standing / no losses),
  the same on every phone. Doesn't count toward stats.
- FREE-FOR-ALL (3 or 4 players): every team fights every other team; last team standing wins (places 1st–4th).
  A special that hits "every enemy" hits every fighter on the ONE team you aim it at. Cards over 12 pts aren't dealt
  (big single cards dominated: the first picker won ~60%; with the cap the pick order splits ~40/33/26%).
  The computer gangs up on whichever team is ahead. Draft is snake order through all players (A B C C B A A B C…).`);

hr('2. THE DRAFT');
out(`- Budget: 10, 20 (default) or 30 points per side (set per mode on the main menu).
- Team size: 1 to 6 fighters. You can lock your team at any time ("Lock team"); you auto-lock if nothing is affordable.
- A wheel spin decides who picks first. Then snake order: A, B, B, A, A, B, B, A…
  Once one side locks, the other keeps picking until they lock or can't afford anything.
- Each character has versions (base, Mark ✦, or Yoriichi prime/age 85, Tengen/Retired Tengen, Muzan/Final Form).
  Only ONE version of a character can be drafted per match, by either side. Taking Giyu rules out Giyu ✦ for everyone.
- POOL (Settings): "Random" (default) deals 12 characters (14 at 30 points), always at least 3 costing 4 or less;
  "All" offers every character. Re-deal is allowed before the first pick (Random pool only).
- 10-point games only deal cards costing 6 or less. 30-point games favour pricier characters and Mark versions.
- Rarity: Yoriichi is dealt in about 1 draft in 8 (prime about 1 in 23); Final-Form Muzan about 1 in 10.
- BACK-POCKET HELPERS (always offered, 1 pt, max ONE per player, no fighter slot): see section 7.
- POOL NOTES in the game list synergies/matchups that are still affordable and possible in the current deal.`);

hr('3. HOW A ROUND RESOLVES');
out(`- Moves: ATTACK (hit one enemy with PWR; Legends strike twice), DEFEND (take half damage this round),
  or SPECIAL (when off cooldown; see each character). Stunned fighters skip the round.
- ORDER: specials with priority act first (priority 3 > 2 > 1), then everyone else by SPD (highest first),
  ties broken randomly. Attacks and Defend have priority 0. Defend takes effect at the start of the round.
- DAMAGE of a hit with base B against a target with DEF D:
    damage = max(1, B − D, ceil(B / 2))      ← DEF can never cut a hit below half
    "ignores DEF":   damage = B
    target DEFENDING: damage = ceil(damage / 2)  (Obanai's special slips past Defend)
    Yoriichi caps: he never takes more than 18 per round (Age 85: 12).
- If an attacker's target is already down, the hit goes to a random living enemy.
- COOLDOWN "N": usable from round 1; after using it, it's ready again N rounds later (cooldown 3: rounds 1, 4, 7…).
  Mark versions recharge 1 round faster.
- END OF ROUND, in order: poison ticks → Shinobu's wisteria damage → demon regeneration → cooldowns tick down.
- STUN: the target loses its next round. POISON: fixed damage at end of round for a number of rounds.
- Back-pocket helpers act at the very start of the round they're used.`);

hr('4. TEAM SYNERGIES AND MATCHUPS (applied at the start of battle)');
out(`Same team:
- Kamaboko Squad: Tanjiro + Zenitsu + Inosuke → whole team +2 SPD.
- Siblings: Tanjiro + Nezuko → when either is hit, the other counter-hits the attacker for 3 (not vs area specials).
- Hashira: 2+ Hashira → each Hashira +1 PWR.
- Upper Moons: 2+ Upper Moons → each +1 regen.
- Muzan's Blood: Muzan + another demon (not Nezuko) → Muzan and those demons +1 PWR.
- Marks spread: 2+ Mark ✦ fighters → each +1 SPD.
- Devoted: Tamayo + Yushiro → Yushiro +2 PWR.
- Sun Lineage: Yoriichi (either) + Tanjiro → Tanjiro +2 PWR.
- Mentor: Urokodaki + Tanjiro / Giyu / Sabito → those pupils +1 DEF.
- Corps Master: Kagaya + any Hashira → every Hashira +1 DEF.
- Final Resolve: Kagaya's special knocks himself out; every Hashira on his team with a Mark card (Giyu, Gyomei, Sanemi,
  Muichiro, Mitsuri, Obanai) awakens it. Killed by an enemy first = nothing. Rengoku, Tengen and Shinobu get nothing.
- Two as One: Gyutaro + Daki → Gyutaro +2 PWR, and if one falls while the other still stands, they get back up at the
  end of the round with 30% (once each). Knock both out in the same round to stop it. (Strong: ~58% when paired.)
- Temari & Arrows: Susamaru + Yahaba → Susamaru's hits slip past Defend.
- Kocho Sisters: Kanae + Shinobu → Shinobu's poison lasts 4 rounds instead of 3.
- Kanae's student: Kanae + Kanao → Kanao +1 PWR.
- Training partner: Yoriichi Type Zero + Muichiro → Muichiro +1 PWR.
Opposing teams:
- Muzan fears the Sun: Muzan facing Yoriichi → Muzan −3 PWR, −2 SPD.
- Kokushibo shaken: Kokushibo facing Yoriichi → −1 DEF.
- Tamayo's medicine: Muzan facing Tamayo → Muzan regen −2.
- Rivals: Zenitsu facing Kaigaku → Zenitsu +2 PWR.
- Wisteria Body: a demon that knocks out Shinobu loses 5 HP every round after (not Akaza: he never eats women).
- Sun Breathing: Yoriichi's special stops every demon it hits from regenerating for good (not Demon King Tanjiro: sun-proof).
Special rules on single cards:
- Nakime never attacks. Her basic move (in place of Attack) is Biwa Strum: an enemy she picks acts last this round
  (always happens first). Castle Shift sends an enemy away for the round: they can't act and can't be hit. If she's
  the last one standing on her team she flees, which counts as a knockout, so never leave her alone.
- Mark Tanjiro ✦ (9 pts): after his first Hinokami Kagura, his next special is the Selfless State (once per match;
  unlocked by winning Destructive Death in the story). It goes before everything, even the biwa. Until Hinokami is
  ready again he can't be hit, stunned, sent away, strummed or arrowed; poison still ticks. Each round he can Attack
  (ignores DEF) or Save a teammate (they take no damage and can't be stunned that round). When the state ends, his
  next Hinokami Kagura can't be blocked by anything (Defend, Dead Calm, hides, dodges, Castle Shift, arrows).
- Kagaya never attacks either. His basic move is Words of Resolve (every ally heals 2, in normal speed order). His
  special Final Resolve knocks himself out and awakens the Mark of every Hashira on his team who has one (stats rise,
  special keeps its current wait). He's slow (SPD 5, 14 HP, 1 DEF) and the special has no priority, so enemies can
  kill him first. Alone on his team he falls, like Nakime.
- Yahaba's Vector Arrows (moves first): every hit the chosen enemy throws this round misses.
- Awakened Nezuko can't Defend (berserk).
- Yoriichi Type Zero strikes three times per Attack at low PWR (great vs low DEF, poor vs tanks). It's a puppet:
  it doesn't count as Yoriichi, so Muzan isn't scared of it.
- Second versions share a slot with the original (one or the other is dealt): Demon King Tanjiro (rare),
  Awakened Nezuko, Retired Tengen, Final-Form Muzan.
- Hantengu: when he falls, all four emotions appear (Sekido, Karaku, Aizetsu, Urogi; small). When the last emotion
  falls they merge into Zohakuten (24 HP, Wood Dragons hits every enemy through Defend). Beat all six bodies.`);

hr('5. EVERY CHARACTER');

- Tengen (6, Hashira) or Retired Tengen (4, not a Hashira, shields an ally).

out(`Each draft offers 3 of the 5 helpers, chosen at random. Drafted from a separate row at the bottom of the draft. In battle, tap the helper chip next to "Lock in moves" on the
round you want; it acts first that round and is then gone.
- Chachamaru (Tamayo's cat): your most hurt fighter (lowest health %) heals half of their CURRENT HP (50% → 75%).
- Kasugai Crow: after both sides lock in, you see the enemy's planned moves (and helper) and may change yours.
  Vs computer, the computer's crow switches any of its fighters you're about to knock out to Defend.
- Muscle Mice (Tengen's mice): every fighter on your team gets +${MICE_PWR} PWR for that round only.
- Hotaru Haganezuka (swordsmith): your fighter with the longest wait for their special gets it ready for next round.
- Kiriya Ubuyashiki (Ambush Orders): pick one of your fighters; that round every enemy that attacks them takes ${AMBUSH_DMG}
  damage back (once per attacker). The other side only learns where the trap was when it springs. Best on the
  fighter the enemy most wants to finish (usually your most hurt one).
Helper strength in simulated realistic matches (side with the helper vs without; 50% = no effect):
Chachamaru ~61%, Kiriya ~59%, Hotaru ~58%, Muscle Mice ~54%, Kasugai Crow ~54% (a thinking human gets more from the Crow).`);

hr('8. MODES AND SETTINGS');
out(`- Vs Computer difficulty: Easy (simple, random-ish), Normal (smart but sloppy), Hard (goes for knockouts, spreads
  damage, saves specials, uses helpers well). Hard beats Normal ~59%, Normal beats Easy ~57%.
- Settings: points (10/20/30), pool (Random/All), playback speed, sound.
- Online at your own pace: 2 players, no need to be on at the same time. Each phone drafts or locks in moves when it's
  that player's turn; a resolved round plays back the next time each player opens the game. The home screen lists
  these games and says whose turn it is. The first pick is a coin flip (no wheel).
- Daily challenge: the same set enemy team, points and goal for everyone that day; you draft from your unlocked
  characters. Goals: win, win within N rounds, or win with a named character still standing. For that last goal the
  named character is already on your squad when the draft opens (its points already spent).
- Battle log: the win screen has a Battle log of every round with a Copy button. The copied text lists both squads, the
  result, then for each round what every player chose for each fighter ("Mia chose: Giyu: Dead Calm · Tanjiro: Attack →
  Akaza") followed by what happened, with damage and healing as % of the fighter's max HP. If a player pastes one,
  use it to point out the rounds where a different move or target would have changed the outcome.
- Shared stats: Settings → Stats and every card show how everyone's games went (win rate, and how often a character
  is picked when dealt), counted from players' finished Local, Online and Quickplay games.
- Story mode: 21 battles with preset (canon) squads, each opening with a short scene. Win a battle to unlock the
  next; won battles can be replayed drafting your own squad (Corps and allies plus that battle's preset characters,
  same points as the preset squad). Twists: survive N rounds, reinforcements joining on a set round, and two-part
  fights where part 2 starts with the enemy already hurt. Boosts (shown on each card) tune the difficulty.

hr('10. STRATEGY NOTES (general)');
out(`- Points efficiency matters more than raw power: what fits exactly into the budget often wins.
- Cheap durable fodder (Murata survives one knockout; Hand Demon) soaks hits and fills leftover points.
- Area specials (Doma, Kokushibo, Gyomei, Mitsuri, Tengen, Nezuko, Muzan) shine against many small fighters;
  big single hits (Rengoku, Akaza, Zenitsu, Old Yoriichi) shine against one or two big fighters.
- Ignore-DEF hits (Tanjiro's special, Doma, Kokushibo, Nezuko, Muzan's whips) are best into high-DEF Hashira/Marks.
- Speed decides who acts first; priority specials (Giyu's Dead Calm, Yushiro, Hantengu, Retired Tengen) go before
  everything — Dead Calm makes your whole team untouchable that round, so baiting enemy specials into it is strong.
- Defend halves damage: use it when you expect a big special on a low-health fighter (Obanai ignores it).
- Stuns (Rui, Kyogai, Gyokko) are very strong in small teams (10-point games).
- Demons regenerate every round: finish them, don't spread chip damage. Yoriichi's special stops regeneration.
- The Crow is best on the round when the enemy's big specials come off cooldown.
- Against people: moves are secret, so mixing Defend and Special timing ("mind games") matters.
- Free-for-all: don't look like the leader. Everyone (the computer too) piles onto the strongest team.`);

  Pick 1  A: Doma (11)            A has 9 left
  Pick 2  B: Tanjiro (5)          B has 15 left
  Pick 3  B: Nezuko (4)           B has 11 left   → Siblings (Tanjiro + Nezuko) on B
  Pick 4  A: Rengoku (7)          A has 2 left
  Pick 5  A: Murata (2)           A has 0 left    → A auto-locks; B keeps picking
  Pick 6  B: Zenitsu (4)          B has 7 left
  Pick 7  B: Inosuke (4)          B has 3 left    → Kamaboko Squad complete on B: +2 SPD for B's whole team
  Pick 8  B: Hand Demon (2)       B has 1 left
  Pick 9  B: Kasugai Crow (1)     B has 0 left    (helper, no fighter slot)
  Result: A = Doma, Rengoku, Murata (3 fighters).  B = Tanjiro, Nezuko, Zenitsu, Inosuke, Hand Demon + Crow.

EXAMPLE DAMAGE: Rengoku (PWR 11) attacks Zenitsu (DEF 2): max(1, 11−2, ceil(11/2)) = 9.
  If Zenitsu Defends: ceil(9/2) = 5. Rengoku's special (PWR+8 = 19) on Zenitsu: max(1, 17, 10) = 17 (Zenitsu has 22 HP).
  Doma's Frozen Lotus (PWR−4 = 10, ignores DEF) hits EVERY enemy for 10, Defend halves it to 5.

EXAMPLE ROUND (teams above): Zenitsu uses Thunderclap and Flash (priority 2), so he acts before everyone using
  Attack, whatever their SPD. He hits Doma for PWR×2 = 14 → max(1, 14−6, 7) = 8 damage.
  Doma uses Frozen Lotus (PWR 14 − 4 = 10, ignores DEF): 10 damage to each of B's fighters; anyone Defending takes 5.
  Tanjiro is hit, but Siblings counters don't trigger on area specials, so Nezuko doesn't strike back this time.
  End of round: Doma regenerates 3 (demons heal every round, so finish them rather than chip at them).`);
