/* ================= STORY MODE =================
   25 battles following the arcs, plus flashbacks (Kanae, two with Yoriichi). Each stage gives you a preset squad (the canon one)
   and opens with a short scene. Once cleared, a stage can be replayed drafting your own squad from the Corps and its
   allies, with the same points as the preset squad.
   After a win, a short ending scene (outro) plays, then any characters the battle unlocks are revealed.
   Twists (one line on the stage card, nothing hidden):
     survive: N        win by still standing at the end of round N (or by beating the enemy first)
     reinforce: [{id, round}]   each fighter joins your team at the start of that round
     start: {id: {hp, poison, devoured}}   an enemy starts the fight already hurt (part 2 of a two-part fight)
   Boosts tune a stage's difficulty and are shown on its card: [{side:0 you / 1 enemy, only:[ids], hp:×, pow:+, def:+, spd:+, label}]
   No DOM. Stage difficulty was checked with the simulator (see CLAUDE.md). */
